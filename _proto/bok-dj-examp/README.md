## Dyer's first set of prototype code using Django, Bokeh, and Isotope.

This code is a mess of prototype stuff.  If you download and install it, you should be able to go to the directory
containing "manage.py" and enter the command "python3 manage.py runserver" to get the web server running on
"http://127.0.0.1:8000/graphs/test" on your local computer.  To share to the world run as
"python3 manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000".
