## Example of Bokeh plot in a web page that continually updates.

Code stolen off the web.  https://github.com/bokeh/bokeh/tree/master/examples/app/ohlc

Download the files into a directory called "ohlc".  Then run "bokeh serve --show ohlc" from the parent directory
of "ohlc" and a browser window or new tab will pop up and will be showing a continuously updateing graph containing
fake random data.
