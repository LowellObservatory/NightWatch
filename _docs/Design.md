## Proposed Design Elements for *NightWatchman*

1. Propose that *NightWatchman* be presented as a website.
2. Propose we use Django for the website, not because we need much interactivity
   for this project but because I think familiarity with Django will serve us well on
   other projects such as the DOL replacement, which may also be a website.
3. Also, there is the possibility that some of the other software developed in the
   future (besides the DOL) will be developed as interactive websites (LOUI replacement, perhaps?).
