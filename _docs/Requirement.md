## *NightWatch* Requirements

*NightWatch* will be a display of current conditions and other data for an observatory allowing various users
to get a quick insight into weather, seeing, instruments being used, facility information, current science image,
and etc.

1. *NightWatch* will display various current satellite maps and radar maps of weather conditions in the region.
2. *NightWatch* will display "Facility Summary" information including pointing, target name, time, filters,
   guide mode, and perhaps a few warnings like sun distance and dome occultation.
3. *NightWatch* will display plots of temperature, humidity, dew point, wind speed, wind gusts, wind direction.
4. *NightWatch* will display the most recent measurment of seeing as well as a plot of seeing vs time.
5. *NightWatch* will display information about which instruments are being used and who is using them.
6. *NightWatch* will display science images and guiding image as they arrive from the instruments.
7. *NightWatch* will display all sky camera images.
8. *NightWatch* will have minimal user controls. It may, however, be configuarable in a file that it reads in.
9. The *NightWatch* window that displays weather radar loops can also display weather satellite loops.
10. *NightWatch* will display UT time in large font.  It will also display Moon Distance.
11. *NightWatch* will display multiple temperatures and humidity values from the sensors in various places.
12. *NightWatch* will display warnings, including wrap warnings. Audible warnings for very bad things are a possibility.
13. *NightWatch* could also display "sky brightness", "extinction", and "flux". (perhaps with plots)
14. As far as displaying science images, we will need password protection. Also, the public program would like to be
    able to display this information including the science images, all sky camera, etc. on Mars Hill.
15. Display size for remote user is an issue. *NightWatch* should adjust its display depending on the size of display.
16. We might want to have a "light" version of the program for users with low bandwith connections to the internet.
17. *NightWatch* may be useful at the mesa, including the 42" and 31" (or its replacement). (keep this in mind when
    designing the system.
18. *NightWatch* should display a video feed from the two dome camera as this will allow users to see if any of the
    calibration lamps have been left on.
19. In the warnings section, *NightWatch* should display any warnings about disk space on the various computers
    getting too full. There should also be weather warnings.
20. If we can fit everything on one of the screens in the control room at the DCT then the two screens we have
    could be mirrored to allow everyone in the room to easily view all the information.
