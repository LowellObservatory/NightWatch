1. Clearly, the ability to use *NightWatchman* at remote site is important.
   Perhaps even looking at it with a phone isn't out of the question.

2. The answer to "why do we need this" was "it will make it much easier to monitor this information for all users".

3. The program or web page will not have any user controls.  It may, however, be configuarable in a file that it reads in.

4. The window that displays weather radar loops can also display weather satellite loops.

5. We'll need to talk to astronomers to determine which parts of the facility summary to display.  UT time in big letters.
   Pointing info, target name.  Moon distance?

6. When displaying temperatures and humidities, remember that there are more than one of each.

7. Warning should be displayed, including wrap warnings.  Audible warnings for very bad things are a possibility.

8. Besides seeing information, we could also display "sky brightness", "extinction", and "flux".

9. As far as displaying science images, we will need password protection.  Also, the public program would like to
   be able to display this information including the science images, all sky camera, etc. on Mars Hill.

10. Display size for remote user is an issue.  The program should adjust its display depending on the size of display.

11. We might want to have a "light" version of the program for users with low bandwith connections to the internet.

12. *NightWatchman* may be useful at the mesa, including the 42" and 31" (or its replacement).

13. *NightWatchman* should display a video feed from the two dome camera as this will allow users to see if any of
    the calibration lamps have been left on.

14. In the warnings section, *NightWatchman* should display any warnings about disk space on the various computers
    getting too full.  There should also be weather warnings.

15. If we can fit everything on one of the screens in the control room at the DCT then the two screens we have
    could be mirrored to allow everyone in the room to easily view all the information.
